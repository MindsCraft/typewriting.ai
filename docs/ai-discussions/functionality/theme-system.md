# Theme System Implementation: July 15, 2023

## Context
The Typewriting.ai application needed a robust theme system to support both light and dark modes with a seamless user experience.

## Problem Statement
We needed to implement a theme system that:
- Respects user preferences from system settings
- Allows manual override
- Persists user selections across sessions
- Avoids UI flicker during page load/hydration

## Solution Approach
Created a React Context-based theme system with:
- Theme provider component for global state management
- Local storage for persistence
- Hydration-safe implementation to prevent flicker
- Support for system preference detection

## Key Implementation Details
- Used React Context API for global theme state management
- Implemented `ThemeProvider` component to wrap the application
- Created `useTheme` hook for easy access to theme controls
- Added local storage persistence with `localStorage.getItem/setItem`
- Created a `ThemeToggle` component with appropriate icons
- Implemented hydration-safe rendering with a mounted state check
