# Documentation System Implementation: July 15, 2023

## Context
Needed a systematic way to document AI assistant discussions and effective prompts for future reference in the Typewriting.ai project.

## Problem Statement
Without a proper documentation system, valuable insights from AI discussions were being lost, making it difficult to:
- Reference past solutions
- Reuse effective prompts
- Maintain consistency in development approaches
- Onboard new team members efficiently

## Solution Approach
Created a structured documentation system with:
- Separate directories for discussions and prompts
- Categorized subdirectories by component type and functionality
- Standardized templates for consistent documentation
- Index files for easy navigation

## Key Implementation Details
- Created main directory structure: `/docs/ai-discussions/` and `/docs/ai-prompts/`
- Established subdirectories by category (components, layout, ui, functionality)
- Created index files with navigation links
- Developed standardized templates for both discussions and prompts
- Included example implementations to demonstrate proper usage
