# Development Roadmap: July 15, 2023

## Context
As the Typewriting.ai project develops, we need to document development decisions including which features to prioritize and which to defer for later implementation.

## Problem Statement
We needed to establish a clear development roadmap to:
- Focus on core functionality first
- Defer non-essential components until the MVP is complete
- Track planned but unimplemented features
- Maintain contextual understanding of commented code

## Solution Approach
Created a phased development plan that:
- Identifies core and non-core components
- Documents temporarily commented-out code
- Sets expectations for future implementation
- Maintains awareness of planned features

## Implementation Decisions

### Phase 1: Core Components (Current)
- Home page layout
- Features section
- Hero section with Calendly integration for booking calls
- Navigation
- Theme system
- Responsive design

### Phase 2: Deferred Components
- **Pricing Section**: Currently commented out, will be implemented when pricing model is finalized
- Advanced user account management
- Integration API endpoints
- Usage analytics dashboard

## Code Status Notes

### Pricing Component
- Current status: Commented out in codebase
- Location: `src/app/home/Pricing.tsx`
- Reason for deferral: Pricing structure not finalized
- Expected implementation: Phase 2
- Dependencies: Finalized pricing model, payment integration
