# CTA Button Link Standardization: July 15, 2023

## Context
To provide a consistent user experience across the Typewriting.ai website, we need to standardize where call-to-action (CTA) buttons direct users.

## Problem Statement
Previously, CTA buttons had inconsistent behavior:
- Some linked to different sections on the same page
- Others had placeholder links
- There was no standard destination for primary actions
- This could cause confusion and reduce conversion rates

## Solution Approach
Implemented a standard approach where:
- All primary CTAs (Start Free, Get Started, etc.) link to the login/signup page
- Book a Call buttons link to Calendly
- Support-related buttons link to the login page (where users can access support)

## Implementation Details

### Primary Action URLs
- All primary CTA buttons now link to: `https://ask.typewriting.ai/login`
- This includes buttons like:
  - "Start Free" in the Hero section
  - "View All Features" in the Features section
  - "Contact Support" in the FAQ section

### Secondary Action URLs
- Consultation booking buttons link to: `https://calendly.com/uddinmoin/typewriting`
- These always open in a new tab using `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`
