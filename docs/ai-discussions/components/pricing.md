# Pricing Component: July 15, 2023

## Current Status
⚠️ **ON HOLD** - This component is currently commented out in the codebase and scheduled for future implementation.

## Context
The Pricing component will display subscription options and pricing tiers for the Typewriting.ai platform.

## Problem Statement
We need to present pricing information in a clear, compelling way that:
- Highlights the value of each tier
- Clearly differentiates features between tiers
- Encourages conversion to paid plans
- Minimizes friction in the purchase decision

## Planned Solution Approach
- Create a responsive pricing card grid
- Use visual hierarchy to highlight recommended plans
- Include feature comparison across plans
- Implement clear CTAs for each pricing tier

## Implementation Status
The component has been created but is currently commented out because:
1. Pricing model is not finalized
2. Payment processing integration is not yet implemented
3. Focus is on core functionality first

## Current Code Location
- `src/app/home/Pricing.tsx` (component file exists but is not imported/used)
- Import statement in main page is commented out

## Placeholder Design
