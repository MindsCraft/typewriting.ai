# Hero Component Implementation: July 15, 2023

## Context
The Hero component serves as the main landing section for the Typewriting.ai website, providing the first impression to visitors and highlighting key actions they can take.

## Problem Statement
We needed to create an impactful hero section that:
- Clearly communicates the company's value proposition as an AI agent platform
- Differentiates from generic chatbot makers
- Provides clear calls-to-action for visitors
- Establishes visual credibility
- Makes it easy for potential clients to book consultation calls

## Solution Approach
Created a responsive hero section with:
- Bold headline that differentiates from competitors ("Not another AI chatbot maker")
- Descriptive subheadline explaining the AI agent functionality
- Two clear CTAs (Start Free and Book a Call)
- Visual representation of the AI agent creation process
- Social proof section with trusted brands

## Key Implementation Details
- Implemented as a React client component
- Used Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Added direct links to login page (https://ask.typewriting.ai/login) for primary CTAs
- Implemented direct Calendly integration for appointment booking
- Created a terminal-style animation to represent AI capabilities
- Added trusted brands section for social proof

## Book a Call Implementation
- Direct link to Calendly URL: https://calendly.com/uddinmoin/typewriting
- Opens in a new tab using `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- Removed the previous click handler that scrolled to the features section
- Styled consistently with the site's button system
