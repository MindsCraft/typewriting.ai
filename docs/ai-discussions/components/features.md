## Context
The Features component displays the core capabilities of the Typewriting.ai platform to potential users.

Used a responsive grid layout with feature cards that include:
- Colored icon containers
- Feature titles
- Descriptions
- Supporting details (for more complex features)

## Key Implementation Details
